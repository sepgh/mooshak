## Introduction

**Mooshak :rocket:** (Farsi for Rocket/Shuttle) provides easy to setup dockerized SSH server, as well as support for [websocket](https://github.com/erebe/wstunnel) tunneling to turn SSH TCP connection look like legitimate HTTP(S) TCP connection.

The purpose of this project is to provide tools to setup `lightweight` and `easy-to-configure` proxy/tunneling service. This can help masking your identity on the internet and avoid internet cencorship.
